# PCI-Passthrough
PCI passthrough allows you to use a physical PCI device (graphics card, network card) inside a VM (KVM virtualization only).

If you "PCI passthrough" a device, the device is not available to the host anymore. Note that VMs with passed-through devices cannot be migrated.

Let's start step by step:


1- In your device BIOS make sure the following is enabled in the BIOS: Intel VT-d & VT-x â€“ Intel Compatible list All AMD CPUs from Bulldozer onwards should be compatible.


2-Enable IOMMU in GRUB (check Intel or AMD commands below - choose the right one) 

command line:

nano /etc/default/grub

inside nano /etc/default/grub you see: 

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet" change to:

for intel CPU:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"

for AMD CPU:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_iommu=on iommu=pt"


3-Verify that IOMMU is enabled by running and looking for a line indicating it is enabled

command line:

dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU
