# PCI-Passthrough
PCI passthrough allows you to use a physical PCI device (graphics card, network card) inside a VM (KVM virtualization only).

If you "PCI passthrough" a device, the device is not available to the host anymore. Note that VMs with passed-through devices cannot be migrated.

Let's start step by step:


1- In your device BIOS make sure the following is enabled in the BIOS: Intel VT-d & VT-x â€“ Intel Compatible list All AMD CPUs.


2-Enable IOMMU in GRUB (check Intel or AMD commands below - choose the right one) 

command line:

nano /etc/default/grub

inside nano /etc/default/grub you see: 

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet" change to:

For intel CPU:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"

Or for AMD CPU:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_iommu=on iommu=pt"


3-Verify that IOMMU is enabled by running and looking for a line indicating it is enabled

command line:

dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU

4-run the command "update-grub" and reboot.

command line:

update-grub

reboot

5-Enable VFIO Modules add the following modules:

command line:

nano /etc/modules

vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqfd

6- run the command update-initramfs -u -k all and reboot

command line:

update-initramfs -u -k all

reboot

7-Verify the modules are enabled with dmesg | grep -i vfio and checking the driver version line is present

command line:

dmesg | grep -i vfio

8-**FOR GPU Passthrough ONLY** Isolation From the Host (amend the below to include the IDs of the device you want to isolate)

Get device IDs command line:

lspci -nn

Example:
echo "options vfio-pci ids=????:????,????:???? disable_vga=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf

9-**FOR GPU Passthrough ONLY** Blacklist GPU drivers (here are all that you would ever need)

echo "blacklist radeon" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nvidia" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nvidiafb" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist nvidia_drm" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 

Reboot your machine, be sure to use the web gui because with the gpu passed through you will no longer get video out. The start up will begin but then appear to hang even though proxmox has started fine.
